;; This is the official Emacs init file for the course IOOPM. It
;; uses English, not because anyone thinks it's cooler than
;; Swedish, but to avoid encoding problems with using Swedish
;; characters. Put it in `~/.emacs.d/init.el` to use it for your
;; own Emacs. You can use as many or as few of these settings as
;; you would like. Experiment and try to find a set-up that suits
;; you!
;;
;; Some settings in this file are commented out. They are the ones
;; that require some choice of parameter (such as a color) or that
;; might be considered more intrusive than other settings (such as
;; linum-mode).
;;
;; Whenever you come across something that looks like this
;;
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-e") 'move-end-of-line)
;;
;; it is a command that sets the keyboard shortcut for some
;; function. If you find a function that you like, whose keyboard
;; shortcut you don't like, you can (and should!) always change it to
;; something that you do like.
